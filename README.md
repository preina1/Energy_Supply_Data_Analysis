# energy_data_analysis
It has been well documented that there is a positive relationship between energy demand and GDP. I was studying Data Science with Python and I became interested in exploring if this positive relationship translates to energy supply and GPD when I analyzed these datasets for a similar task.

In this analysis I used Pandas and Matplotlib to clean and merge two datasets: energy supply and GDP. The sources of these datasets are the [United Nations](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/data/) and the [World Bank] (https://data.worldbank.org/)
